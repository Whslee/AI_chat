## Title
Evaluate the quality of AI responses

## Introduction
With the recent development of large language models, the AI's response will change according to the user's prompt, and the evaluation of the AI's task performance will be based on how well it fits the user's preferences rather than quantitative evaluation.

To evaluate how well the AI is performing according to the user's preferences, we want to create a model to evaluate the quality of the chatbot by rating the user's preferences as 0 and 1 after the chatbot and the user interact.

Therefore, the purpose of this project is to present a clear response evaluation metric and to quantitatively evaluate and improve AI response quality based on it.
