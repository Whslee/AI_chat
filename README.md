## Title
Classifying different types of kimchi in Korea with FastAI

## Introduction
While eating, I suddenly realized that I seem to enjoy eating kimchi so much that my table is never without it.

There are many different types of kimchi, but I usually eat 'cabbage kimchi' and 'cucumber sobakki', so if there are other kimchi side dishes, would I be able to distinguish them? I thought it would be fun to create a classification model that can tell you what kind of kimchi you are eating when you take a picture of it, so I decided to do this as a class project.

This project is not just about classifying kimchi, but it is a familiar task because it can be used universally if it is trained with various data based on the vision classification model I designed.

## Description of the Dataset
### Distribution of classes in the training dataset
#### Data Class
Green onion kimchi/ White Kimchi/ Young radish kimchi/ Kkakdugi/ Raw radish vegetables 
5 classes
#### Total number of data
1000 images of each class / 5000 images in total

#### Accuracy evaluation
Precision, Recall, F1-score, Accuracy, Macro average

### Train, test Dataset in google drive
When training the model, the training and validation datasets are divided

training data size 0.8/ validation data size 0.2
